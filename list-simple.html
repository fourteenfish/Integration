<div class="explanation">
    <h1>List CPD entries</h1>
    <p>This page is very simple, and just contains a single iframe. The code in the <a href="scripts/message.js">scripts/message.js</a> file ensures that the iframe is always tall enough to accomodate its content and avoids the iframe having scrollbars.</p>
    <p>You could argue that it's strange to show a link to this page to the user before they have recorded any CPD. If you'd like to hide the page initially, let us know and we can send a callback to your server when the user records their first CPD entry along with their <strong>userId</strong> to enable you to show or hide the link to this page.</p>
    <p>It is possible to allow the user to <a href="list-record.html">record CPD from this page</a> as well.</p>
